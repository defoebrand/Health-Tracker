### To Use The API 
Replace any words that begin as `:` with your search criteria. For example, to get all users who are 33 years old, use   
`GET /age/32` 
  
`- GET / ` will retrieve all users registered with this app  

`- GET /age/:age ` will retrieve all users that match the given age  

`- GET /sex/:sex' `  will retrieve all users that match the given sex  
Sex options are `XX` or `XY`  

`- GET /ethnicity/:ethnicity ` will retrieve all users that match the given ethnicity  
Ethnicity options are as follows:  
-   `European` 
-   `Central & South Asian`
-   `East Asian & Native American` 
-   `Sub-Saharan African` 
-   `Western Asian & North African` 
-   `Melanesian`  


`- GET /height/:scale/:height ` will retrieve all users that match the given height.  
Scale options are `Metric` or `Imperial`  

`- GET doctors `  will retrieve all doctors registered with this app  

`- GET communities `  will retrieve all communities available in this app  

Searches by preferred gender, ranges for height, weight, and age, as well as high blood pressure and high blood sugar will become available with a future update
