# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or find_or_create_byd alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.e([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.find_or_create_by(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
